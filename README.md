## The stack

This is an example project generated with the GraphCMS Developer
Portfolio and Blog starter.

- **[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)**: Manage projects and blog
  posts.
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: A powerful framework that
  lets us query data and use endpoints for server side data.
- **[Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/)**: For an intuitive Git based
  workflow with seamless publishing.

## How to use

âš TODO!

Rename the `sample.env` file to `.env` and add your own Content API
endpoint.

```bash
mv sample.env .env
```

Install dependencies and run local dev server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
